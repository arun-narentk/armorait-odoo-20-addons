# Universal QR Generator

Generate secure, token-based QR codes for any Odoo 20 record. Print on reports and labels, track scans, and configure multiple QR actions without model-specific code.

## Business Problem

Most QR modules only cover one document type (invoice or sale order). Teams need one engine that works across sales, warehouse, CRM, HR, products, and custom models.

## Features

- Generic QR engine via `rn.qr.mixin` on all models
- Token URLs (`/rn/qr/<token>`) instead of exposing database IDs
- Payload options: secure URL, internal URL, public URL, record name, barcode, custom text
- Action options: open record, portal page, PDF download, custom URL, server action
- Size, color, logo overlay, and ECC level controls
- Expiration policies and regeneration
- Scan statistics with user, device, and IP logging
- Bulk ZIP export from list selections
- QR templates for warehouse, office, customer, and manufacturing
- Report blocks on quotation, invoice, purchase order, and delivery slip
